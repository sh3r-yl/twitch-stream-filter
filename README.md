# twitch-stream-filter (SG Streams)

Twitch stream filter is a tool to filter specific subsets of streams (currently SG streamers) by using the Twitch search API.

### So what's this about?

Basically, ever since Twitch removed the communities functionality, people are having trouble finding other local (Singaporean/SG) streamers. This page serves as a sort of directory listing of other SG streamers so that we can find other them (not sure why, but we SG people like to search out other SG people). Be aware that this is not an exhaustive list of SG streamers and some may be well hidden in the depths of twitchverse.

### So how do you find me?

We're just using what most people are already using, the [SG/EN] tag (is there an SG/CN? not sure but that's not implemented yet). Without going into much detail, Twitch doesn't just search for SG/EN but they also search for SG somewhere in your description, etc. so there's bound to be false matches. Should you find a false match, just drop us a message.

### How do I get included into the list?

Make sure you include 'SG/EN' as part of your stream title, optionally, 'SG' itself may also work but with no guarantee. If you have the correct stream title but still can't get it to work, let me know.
